# Meeting At 10

Public website for Meeting At 10, the eleven students who build ACCS for the QCU College of Computer Studies. Next.js 16 and React 19, exported as static files to `out/`. This site has its own styles and components and does not use the design system.

## Run and verify

Use Node.js 22, matching CI.

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Run the checks serially on the shared development machine:

```bash
flock /tmp/claude-1000/capstone-build.lock pcore npm run lint
flock /tmp/claude-1000/capstone-build.lock pcore npm run typecheck
flock /tmp/claude-1000/capstone-build.lock pcore npm run verify
```

`verify` builds the static export and runs the Node.js content tests against `out/`. On the scaffold commit the tests fail because the page is empty. They define what the rebuild must contain.

## Build-time URLs

`src/lib/sites.ts` reads these public environment variables when the site builds.

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_LANDING_URL` | https://access-ccs.com |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PORTAL_URL` | https://portal.access-ccs.com |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DESIGN_URL` | https://design.access-ccs.com |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_MEETING_URL` | https://team.access-ccs.com |

The rebuild spec is `context/deltas/2026-11-07-v2-rebuild.md`.
